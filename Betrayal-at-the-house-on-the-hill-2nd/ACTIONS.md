## Movement

You can move up to number of spaces equal to your character's current Speed. Whenever a game effect makes you draw a card, you must STOP moving for the rest of your turn. 

# Discovering a New Room

When your explorer enters a doorway, and there isn't a room on the other side, look at the top tile on the room stack. If it has the name of the floor you are on (ground floor, basement, or upper floor), turn it over and connect it to the doorway you just entered. Then move into that room. Add each new tile as logically as you can, creating adjacent rooms with connecting doors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Connect doorways whenever possible

If the top tile can't go on the floor you're currently on, set it aside facedown in a discard pile. Keep setting tiles aside until you find one that works on your floor. (Some tiles work on more than one floor).

# Drawing Omen, Item, and Event Cards

A room may have a card symbol on it. The first time you discover a room with a card symbol, you must end your move in that room and draw the appropriate card.

If the room has a spiral symbol , draw an event card. Read it out loud. Follow its instructions, which may require you to attempt rolls. Then discard the card unless it says otherwise or has an ongoing effect.

If the room has a bull's head symbol , draw an item card. Read it out loud. Place it face up in front of you; you now have it in your possession. You may use it once immediately and once on each of your turns, unless it says otherwise.

If the room has a raven symbol , draw an omen card. Read it out loud. Place it face up in front of you; you now have it in your possession. You might have to do something immediately. At the end of your turn, you must make a haunt roll.

## Using Items and Omen Cards

You can use an item once at any point during your turn. Most omen cards (except the Bite card) are also items you keep, and they're used like other items.

Some items, like the Armor, can't be traded, but they can be dropped or picked up.

Some omens, like the Dog, aren't items at all, so they can't be dropped or traded. They're companions that follow the explorer who has custody of them. (The Dog, Girl, and Madman all work this way).

## Haunt Roll

Before the haunt starts, you must roll 6 dice at the end of your turn __each time you draw an omen card__. This is called a haunt roll. If you roll less than the total number of omen cards all players have drawn this game, the haunt starts. The player who starts the haunt with this roll is called the haunt revealer.
