# Actions

During ypur turn you can do as many of the following

- You can [move](ACTIONS.md#movement).
- You can [discover a new room](#discovering-a-new-room).
- You can attempt a die roll.
- You can [use items or omen cards](#Using-Items-and-Omen-Cards).
- You can attack (once during your turn after the haunt starts).

Once during your turn, you can do each of the following:

- Give an item to another explorer in the same room (assuming you both agree).
- Drop any number of items. (If you do, put an Item Pile token in that room). Another explorer (or you, for that matter) can later pick up some or all of the items in the pile, removing the token if all of the items are picked up.
- Pick up one or more items from a pile of items.

At end of your turn

- [Haunt Roll](ACTIONS.md#haunt-roll) (if you drew an omen card and Haunt hasnt started)
- Release Board Control to Next Player

## Movement

You can move up to number of spaces equal to your character's current Speed. Whenever a game effect makes you draw a card, you must STOP moving for the rest of your turn. 

# Discovering a New Room

When your explorer enters a doorway, and there isn't a room on the other side, look at the top tile on the room stack. If it has the name of the floor you are on (ground floor, basement, or upper floor), turn it over and connect it to the doorway you just entered. Then move into that room. Add each new tile as logically as you can, creating adjacent rooms with connecting doors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Connect doorways whenever possible

If the top tile can't go on the floor you're currently on, set it aside facedown in a discard pile. Keep setting tiles aside until you find one that works on your floor. (Some tiles work on more than one floor).

## Using Items and Omen Cards

You can use an item once at any point during your turn. Most omen cards (except the Bite card) are also items you keep, and they're used like other items.

Some items, like the Armor, can't be traded, but they can be dropped or picked up.

Some omens, like the Dog, aren't items at all, so they can't be dropped or traded. They're companions that follow the explorer who has custody of them. (The Dog, Girl, and Madman all work this way).

## Haunt Roll

Before the haunt starts, you must roll 6 dice at the end of your turn __each time you draw an omen card__. This is called a haunt roll. If you roll less than the total number of omen cards all players have drawn this game, the haunt starts. The player who starts the haunt with this roll is called the haunt revealer.
